# Optum Climate Supporters (OCS)


### Description:
- We all are aware of the urgent requirement of sustainable development. Recycle and Recovery is one of the ways to achieve it.
- In order to recycle the products efficiently, we require appropriate waste management support system.
- This calls for a transparent and trustworthy platform which will form a link between product user and waste collector where both are in win-win situation. 
- The portal can be accessed by a product user or a waste collector.

##### Waste Collection Portal : Steps
- A product User can sign up to the portal and login. 
- The user can now place a new order wherein product name and its weight can be entered in the Waste Collection Form. 
- Upon submission, user can review the orders placed and the amount of waste that was collected. This will help the user realize how much waste gets generated over the period of time.
- Upon successful waste collection, the user gets rewards points which can be redeemed through the portal.
- A waste collector can sign up to the portal and login. 
- The collector can check the requests received. Then collector can check the route to the userâ€™s address and the duration to reach the same. The collector can accept/ decline the request. 
- The collector through the portal has an inventory of the different products collected (along with its weight) which will help him/her to recycle.
- The collector upon successful waste collection, gets rewards points which can be redeemed through the portal for eco-friendly purchases or cash reward equivalent to the reward points collected.
- This portal will expedite the digitization of waste management in an efficient and transparent manner. This will promote sustainable living.
